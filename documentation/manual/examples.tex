\label{chap:Examples}

In this chapter we describe 4 examples: 1) a closed-set
identification task, 2) an adaptive speech in noise identification
task, and 3) an adaptive just noticeable difference task (gap
detection), and 4) same as 3, but modified to the attention span
and interest of young children. Each example consists of 1) a
general description, 2) the concept, and 3) the implementation in
XML.

It is advised to run the experiment before reading the details.
The experiment files are stored in the \apex directory under
\filename{examples/manual} in the \apex folder, together with
sound files and figures of the respective experiments. Note again:
if the experiment file has the extension ``.apx'' it remains an
XML file that can be edited with OxygenXML. The results file will
automatically have the extension ``.results''. \textbf{(needs to
be done)}.
