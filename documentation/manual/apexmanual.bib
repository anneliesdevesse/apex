                   threshold (SRT) for sentences in quiet or in noise has
                   been developed. It is shown that with ten carefully
                   selected lists of only 13 sentences each, a high
                   test-retest reliability can be obtained. The standard
                   deviation of SRT measured with the different lists is
                   approximately 1 dB.},
