% Apex 3 Matlab Toolbox (AMT)
%
% $Rev$
%
% An XMl description for each element in an experiment file can be generated
% by the corresponding a3<element-name> function.
%
% Examples of efficient experiment creation using the AMT can be found in
% the examples-create directory
%
% Examples of result analysis using the AMT can be found in  the
% examples-results directory
%
% Please edit a3localsettings.m before first use
% For all functions of the AMT to be available, all settings defined
% in a3localsettings-template.m must be defined. However, not all
% functions in the AMT depend on them, so you could be just fine
% not defining them.
%
% Run regressiontest to see whether your system is properly setup for the AMT
