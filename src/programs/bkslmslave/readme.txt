To run slm2250server.exe the contents of Bruel&Kjaer's management suite program
should be in a folder with the name "ExecuteLibrary" in the same folder as the
.exe.

As C# is not a supported language for proto2, the compiled files are directly
distributed. If necessary, they can be regenerated with
